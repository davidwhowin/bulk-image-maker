Set up the bulk image optimizer project with:
- Vite + React + TypeScript configuration
- Tailwind CSS with custom configuration
- Essential dependencies (Zustand, Headless UI, testing libraries)
- Folder structure as specified in architecture
- ESLint and Prettier configuration
- Git hooks for code quality

Think hard about the optimal project structure before implementing.
